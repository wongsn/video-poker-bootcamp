// calcHandScore
// After we have a playable version of the game, add logic to calcHandScore.
// Add logic for detecting each hand (e.g. full-house, flush, 2 pair) 1 at a time. 
// Test the logic for each hand before moving onto the next hand.
// Consider using a JS Object to track frequencies of specific ranks or suits. This might make it easier to detect hands such as flushes, full houses, and X-of-a-kind. See 0.4: JS Object as Tally for an example.
// Hard-code the arrays of card objects we will need to test our logic.
// Put these test hands in a separate file, e.g. testHands.js.
// Don't forget to test the negative cases, e.g. do we still win/lose the right number of points if we don't get the hand we are currently testing?
