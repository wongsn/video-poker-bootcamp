// Create an empty helper function called calcHandScore that returns a fixed number of points for now, e.g. 1.

  // Use JSDoc function commenting with the following attributes.
  // Description of function
  // Description of each parameter
  // Description of return value
// calcHandScore will take an array of card objects and return the number of points that the user scored for the cards in their hand.
// Abstracting calcHandScore allows us to construct the primary game logic without worrying about hand-scoring logic.
// It will also make testing hand-scoring logic easier because we can test scoring of individual hands without running the whole game.

// Code the primary game logic using calcHandScore wherever we wish to calculate the score of a given hand. This logic should include the following.
  // The user has a global number of points.
  // The user clicks a button to deal cards.
  // The user selects which cards they want to keep.
  // The game replaces the unselected cards, calculates the hand score, and updates total points.
// Lay out game controls for mobile (portrait orientation), and set the max-width CSS property of the container so the layout is still friendly on a wider screen.
